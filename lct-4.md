#### Aim: Let's C what you can do

Basic C code
* Source Code:
	* Put in .c files (convention)
	* Naming convention: snake_case
* Compiling (with command `gcc`)
	* Compiles to architecture specific (OS + Processor) executable files
	* Default name of compiled file is a.out
	* gcc option: -o \<file\> compiles to the given file name
	* Run file with ./\<file\>
		* C checks the $PATH for the file if you just type in the file name, unless you specify  it's directory
