We learned the basics of C programming by creating a file and compiling it. Here are the steps to creating your very own executable C file: 
1. Write source code in a text editor and save with the `.c` extension. <br>
	* **Note**: The naming convention for C is **snake_case**, _where all words are lowercase and distinct words are separated by underscores._ 
  
2. Open the command line and type in `gcc <filename>`. <br>
	* **gcc** stands for "GNU C Compiler", and compiles the file to the architecture specific (OS + Processor) executable file. 
  
3. ``ls`` to list the files in your current directory. 
   * You will see an ``a.out`` file, which is the default name of a compiled file in the C programming language. 
4. Run the executable file: `./a.out`

OPTIONAL BUT **HIGHLY** RECOMMENDED <br>
Rename your `a.out` file! Despite it being the default name, it's by no means descriptive and will be overwritten if another C file is compiled within the same directory. <br><br>
To do so: <br>
``gcc -o <new_filename> <filename>``<br> 
\* `new_filename` does not include an extension. 
<br><br>
Example: <br>
If I did: `gcc -o hi hello.c`<br>
I rename the compiled hello.c to `hi`.
